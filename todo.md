## Review Section

### Changes Made So Far:
1. **Infrastructure Setup**: Successfully deployed frontend to Vercel and backend to Render
2. **AI Integration**: Implemented restricted AI assistant with 4 specific functions (clarity, professional, grammar, summary)
3. **Compliance**: Changed from BRCGS to GMP standard (configurable)
4. **Database Design**: Created comprehensive schema for all 6 modules
5. **Standalone Version**: Created working HTML file for immediate use
6. **Form Improvements**: Added time field for incident reporting

### Current Status:
- Backend is live and working at https://ohisee-backend.onrender.com
- OpenAI integration is configured and functional
- Database schema is ready but not yet deployed
- Frontend has deployment issues that need resolution
- Standalone HTML version provides immediate functionality

### Next Priority Actions:
1. Complete user authentication system
2. Implement email notifications
3. Create navigation structure for all modules
4. Deploy PostgreSQL database
5. Build out each module incrementally

### Known Issues:
- CORS blocking local file access to backend
- Vercel not properly deploying API routes
- Need to implement proper error handling
- Email notifications not yet configured

### Notes:
- Following CLAUDE.md workflow for simple, incremental changes
- Each module should be built independently but share common components
- Focus on getting core functionality working before adding advanced features
- Prioritize user experience and simplicity over complex features
